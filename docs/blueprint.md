## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted teal (#66A5AD) to evoke a sense of calm and serenity, inspired by the application's focus on spirituality and learning.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated teal (#E0F4F1), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for the content.
- Accent color: Light desaturated Yellow-Green (#A6CF98), used for interactive elements like quiz buttons, creating a gentle contrast and guiding the user's attention.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for body text to ensure readability and give a literary feel, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for headers to maintain a modern and clean look.
- Fully responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure a consistent user experience.
- Use minimalist, calming icons relevant to Islamic themes for UI elements (e.g., play button for audio, question mark for quiz).
- Subtle animations for transitions and feedback, such as a gentle fade-in for content or a brief highlight on correct quiz answers.
